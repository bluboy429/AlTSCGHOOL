    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</H2> 
        <h2>Iâ€™m Aje Blessed, an aspiring Cloud Engineer with a background in Quantity Surveying. Yeah, I knowâ€”big switch, but hear me out. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology, especially how the cloud powers everything from small apps to massive enterprise systems. That curiosity led me to enroll in the Cloud Engineering program at AltSchool Africa.<br/> Why AltSchool? Because I needed a structured, hands-on learning path. I didnâ€™t just want to watch tutorials; I wanted to build real projects, get my hands dirty with AWS, and actually understand cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps principles. My goal is simple: master cloud computing, get skilled in DevOps, and land a solid engineering role.<br/> Throughout this program, Iâ€™m looking to sharpen my skills in areas like CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform, and infrastructure as code (IaC). More importantly, I want to build, break, and fix thingsâ€”because thatâ€™s the best way to learn. Long term, I see myself working as a DevOps Engineer, helping companies deploy and manage scalable, efficient systems.

            This is just the beginning. Letâ€™s build. ðŸš€<br/></h2>
